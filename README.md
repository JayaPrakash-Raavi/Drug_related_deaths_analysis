📌 Introduction
Drug-related deaths are a major public health issue in the United States, with fatal overdoses, chronic substance abuse complications, and behavior-induced fatalities continuing to rise. In 2021 alone, 106,699 drug overdose deaths were recorded, highlighting the growing crisis.

This project investigates drug-related deaths, focusing on how different drugs impact young people’s lives. By analyzing trends in cause of death, our goal is to provide insights that could help prevent future tragedies.

🏆 Project Goals
✔️ Understand the impact of drugs on young people’s lives
✔️ Identify patterns and trends in drug-related deaths
✔️ Classify drugs into categories based on their effects
✔️ Analyze death rates based on demographics (age, sex, race)
✔️ Perform clustering analysis on geospatial data
✔️ Provide insights to help mitigate drug-related deaths

📂 Dataset
📌 Name: Drug Related Deaths Dataset
📅 Time Period: January 2012 – December 2022
📊 Size: 48 variables, 10,654 observations
🔍 Data Source: [Include source if available]

🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔️ Removed missing data (Date, Date Type, Age, Sex, Race)
✔️ Formatted columns (Date, Age adjustments)
✔️ Replaced empty cells with NA
✔️ Added three new columns for drug classifications:

Opioids
Psychostimulants
Sedatives
✔️ Handled overlapping drug use cases
✔️ Identified trends in death rates over the years
📊 Data Analysis Insights
📈 Overall Trends:

Monthly drug-related death rates are increasing
Death rates are rising for all drug types
Both men and women are affected
Senior groups (older adults) have a higher death rate
📌 Demographic Analysis:

Deaths across age groups (19-30, 31-40, senior groups) show distinct trends
Concave curves suggest higher risk among young adults (19-40)
Convex curves suggest that older adults contribute more to total deaths
🌍 Geospatial Analysis:

Mapping drug-related deaths across regions
Clustering Analysis to identify high-risk zones
🏁 Key Takeaways & Conclusion
🚨 Drug-related deaths are on the rise and need immediate attention
👴 Older adults face higher death rates than younger groups
🧠 Mental health and drug usage correlation should be explored further
⚡ Actionable Insights: Policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers can use this analysis to develop strategies for prevention and intervention
